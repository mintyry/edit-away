## Description 📰

editAway is a text editor app. Content/data persists using indexedDB.
The main significance and motivation for this app though was implementing a bundler package and making this app a progressive web application (PWA), allowing the development to be bundled and organized in a more efficient manner and making it downloadable as a native app as well as usable offline! In creating this, I learned more about separating the client code from server-side in terms of what gets deployed, and I learned the concept of bundlers (Webpack) and how to transform a web app to a native app.

## Installation 🔌

In order to install, please run `npm i`.


<a id="Usage"></a>
## Usage 🧮

To use this app, simply type and edit away!
If user clicks out of the app or even closes it, the content they entered will still remain there once they re-open the app. Additionally, user can click the install button (or the option in the URL bar) to download the PWA, and editAway both on and offline.
